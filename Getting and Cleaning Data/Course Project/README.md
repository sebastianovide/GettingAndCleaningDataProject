## Downloading the data
```
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip", "Dataset.zip")
unzip("Dataset.zip")
```
## Running the script
It assumes that a ```combined``` folder doesn't exist. The script must run from the same folder from where the previous commands to download and unzip the data set were run.

## 1
I'm creating a new set of files in a new folder called ```combined```. As all the files have exaclty the same number of rows, we can safely append the files from the test folder into those of the data folder and save them into the new folder.
